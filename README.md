# SensorWeb
This project is aimed at collecting gyroscope and accelerometer data from a mobile device and syncing it to a Firebase database. The same data is streamed to the website in real-time.
The collected data can be used for a wide range of applications such as motion tracking, activity recognition, and fitness monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Android Studio: to develop the mobile application <br>
- Firebase Realtime Database: to store the collected data <br>
- Java: to write the code for the mobile application <br>
- JavaScript: to write the code for the website <br>

## Installation
- To use this project, you will need: <br> 
- Android Studio version 4.1 or higher <br>
- A Firebase account

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine. <br>
- Open the project in Android Studio. <br>
- Connect your mobile device to the computer and run the application. <br>
- The application will start collecting gyroscope and accelerometer data from the mobile device. <br>
- The collected data will be synced to a Firebase Realtime Database. <br>
- The website will use Firebase's Realtime Database API to display the collected data. <br>
- You can view the collected data in the Firebase console and on the website. <br>
