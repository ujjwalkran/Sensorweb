# Sensor
This project is aimed at collecting gyroscope and accelerometer data from a mobile device and syncing it to a Firebase database. The same data is streamed to the website in real-time.
The collected data can be used for a wide range of applications such as motion tracking, activity recognition, and fitness monitoring.

# Technologies Used
Android Studio: to develop the mobile application
Firebase Realtime Database: to store the collected data
Java: to write the code for the mobile application
JavaScript: to write the code for the website
